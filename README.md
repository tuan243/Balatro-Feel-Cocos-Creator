# 🎴 Balatro Feel Demo (Cocos Creator Edition)

A small demo built with **Cocos Creator**, inspired by [@mixandjam's Unity project](https://github.com/mixandjam/balatro-feel), which explores the *game feel* behind the hit game **Balatro**.

This project attempts to **replicate the satisfying interactions and visual effect** seen in Balatro — but implemented using **Cocos Creator** instead of Unity.

> ⚠️ Note: This is not a full game, just a focused exploration of feel and polish.
